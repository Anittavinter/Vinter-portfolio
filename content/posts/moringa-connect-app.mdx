### The Vision

Moringa Connect was born out of a shared desire to bridge the gap between graduates and opportunities after tech bootcamp life. As a team of alumni, we asked: **What if we could build a tool to keep us all connected, supported, and growing?**

### Core Features

- Mentorship Matching – Connect juniors with seniors in tech
- Job Board – Curated opportunities from alumni and partners
- Event Hub – Stay updated on tech meetups, workshops, and alumni mixers

### Why It Matters

This app reflects what I care about: using tech to empower real communities. It’s not just a school project—it’s a living platform built by us, for us. And it’s only getting better.
